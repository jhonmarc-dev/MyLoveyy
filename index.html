      <h2>Hi, Love 💌</h2>
      <p>Before anything else, I want you to know...</p>
      <p>You're the most amazing person I've ever met. This little page is my way of showing just a piece of how much you mean to me.</p>
      <p>I know life gets busy and overwhelming sometimes, but always remember that I’m here, loving you in every moment, in every way I can.</p>
      <p>You deserve to feel special, because you truly are. Every little reason I wrote here came from the way you’ve touched my life.</p>
      <p>Read them slowly, smile a little, and know that someone out here is deeply, madly, and genuinely in love with you.</p>
      <p>Always yours, <br><strong>JM 🫶</strong></p>
